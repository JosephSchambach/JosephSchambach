- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JosephSchambach
- ðŸ‘€ I love learning new skills, meeting new people, and when I am not developing my skills in data science and software and data engineering, I am probably spending time with my family or out trail running somewhere.  
- ðŸŒ± Bachelors of Science in Data Science and Analytics from Thomas Edison State University in Trenton, NJ
- I'd love to connect to collaborate or discuss opportunities! My LinkedIn is connected to this profile. Don't hesitate to send me a PM.
